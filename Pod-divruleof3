Proof of Divisibility Rule of 3
We can prove the divisibility rule of 3 with the help of an example.

Consider the number 4368.

Let us expand this number as given below:

4368 = 4 × 1000 + 3 × 100 + 6 × 10 + 8 × 1

= 4 × (999 + 1) + 3 × (99 + 1) + 6 × (9 + 1) + 8 × 1

= (4 × 999 + 3 × 99 + 6 × 9) + (4 × 1 + 3 × 1 + 6 × 1 + 8 × 1)

= (4 × 999 + 3 × 99 + 6 × 9) + (4 + 3 + 6 + 8)

We know that 9, 99, 999,… are divisible by 3, and thus the multiples of these numbers are also divisible by 3.

So, the divisibility of 4368 is now dependent on the sum 4 + 3 + 6 + 8.

Here, 4, 3, 6 and 8 are the digits of the number 4368.

    int isPossible(int N, int arr[]) {
        int sum = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            int it = arr[i];
            while(it > 0) {
                sum += it % 10;
                it /= 10;
            }
        }
        return sum % 3 == 0;
    }
